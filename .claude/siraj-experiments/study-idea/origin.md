# Origin: study-idea skill

**Created:** 2026-02-10
**Inspiration:** User need to systematically assimilate ideas from the internet into a personal skill ecosystem
**Initial examples studied:**
- https://github.com/parkerhancock/browser-canvas (Claude Code plugin for real-time UI rendering)
- https://github.com/rohitg00/pro-workflow (Claude Code plugin for optimized AI-dev workflows)

## Key Insight

The user learns best by doing: studying a new idea deeply, mapping it to what they already know,
and then building something that bridges the two. This skill automates that research-to-integration
pipeline so every interesting URL becomes a potential skill enhancement.

## Design Decisions

- **Two-phase workflow**: Study first, build second — because reviewing before committing prevents
  wasted effort and ensures the user stays in control of their skill ecosystem.
- **ORIGIN.md traceability**: Every skill built from this process tracks back to its source idea,
  creating a knowledge graph over time.
- **Deep dive by default**: Surface-level summaries don't lead to real integration. Reading actual
  source code reveals transferable patterns that READMEs don't.
- **Feather-spec alignment**: When building complex skills, use the user's feather-spec framework
  for requirements, maintaining consistency across the ecosystem.
