## Executive Summary

{2-3 sentences: what this is, what makes it interesting, and the single biggest insight.}

---

## Source Analysis

### Overview

{What does this project/article/tool do? Who made it? What problem does it solve?}

### Architecture & Key Patterns

{How is it structured? What design patterns does it use? What are the key architectural
decisions? Include diagrams if helpful.}

### Technical Stack

{Languages, frameworks, dependencies, infrastructure. What does it build on?}

### Strengths

{What does this do particularly well? What's innovative or clever?}

### Limitations

{What are the known issues, gaps, or weaknesses? What does the community say?}

### Comparison with Existing Ecosystem

{What tools, skills, or workflows does the user already have that overlap with this source?
For each existing tool, describe what it does, where it lives, and its philosophy.
Then provide a side-by-side comparison table showing where the new source differs.
End with a "key takeaway" — do they complement, compete, or replace each other?}

#### {Existing Tool 1 Name}
- **Location:** {path}
- **What it does:** {description}
- **Philosophy:** {approach/tradeoffs}

#### {Existing Tool 2 Name}
{Same structure}

#### How {source name} differs

| Aspect | {Existing Tool 1} | {Existing Tool 2} | {New Source} |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| {dimension} | ... | ... | ... |

**Key takeaway:** {Do they complement, compete, or replace each other? What stage of the workflow does each serve?}

## Core Ideas Extracted

{Focus on transferable patterns and techniques — not just features.}

### Idea 1: {Name}

- **What:** One-sentence description
- **How:** Technical approach (2-3 sentences max)
- **Why it matters:** What problem does this solve or what capability does it unlock?
- **Key pattern:** The reusable technique or approach, abstracted from this specific implementation
- **Transferability:** How easily can this pattern be applied elsewhere? (High/Medium/Low)

### Idea 2: {Name}

{Same structure}

### Idea N: {Name}

{Same structure}

## Integration Map

| # | New Idea | Existing Skill | Integration Type | Opportunity | Effort | Impact |
|---|----------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|--------|--------|
| 1 | {idea} | {skill or "none"} | {Enhance / New / Workflow / Reference} | {description} | {Low/Med/High} | {Low/Med/High} |

---

## Feasibility Assessment

### Technical Feasibility

{Can this be built with Claude Code's current capabilities? What tools/APIs are needed?}

### Dependencies

{External services, packages, or tools required}

### Risks

{Could this break existing skills? Any security or privacy concerns?}

---

## Recommendations

### Quick Wins (Low effort, high impact)

{Things that can be built or integrated in a single session}

1. {recommendation with rationale}

### Strategic Integrations (Higher effort, transformative)

{Things worth investing time in because they fundamentally improve the ecosystem}

1. {recommendation with rationale}

### Reference Only (Interesting but not actionable now)

{Worth knowing about but no clear integration path today}

1. {insight and why it's worth remembering}

---

## Proposed Experiments

### Experiment 1: {Name}

- **Goal:** What should this experiment prove or create?
- **Approach:** How to build it (high-level steps)
- **Based on ideas:** {reference idea numbers from above}
- **Success criteria:** How to know if it worked
- **Estimated effort:** {time estimate}

### Experiment 2: {Name}

{Same structure}

---

## Next Steps

**Recommended first build:** {which experiment to start with and why}

**Open questions:** {anything that needs more research or user input before building}
